In JavaScript a bunch of letters, numbers, words or anything else is known as a **String** (as in a string of characters). Strings have to begin AND end with a quotation mark. Single ' or double " is fine, just make sure you use the same at the beginning as you do at the end. This can make using *the other* type of quotes in a sentence much easier. For instance:

```javascript
"It's a stringy world."
```

For this lesson, change the `console.log()` you did in the last lesson to print `"It's a stringify world."` as noted above. When you're finished, remember to run this with `learnjs verify program.js` and if you want to test your program remember to use `node program.js`.
